</span>

>Have you ever glanced at a public toilet but refrained from
using it after noticing how unclean it is?
Our project targets to change this perception about public
toilets and create new norm about them!
We have designed a website through which a user can spread
awareness about where a public toilet is lacking.
Our project will help the required authorities to maintain and
repair the required public toilets based on the information
gathered by our website, which has been taken from the users
themselves.
Our site also can be used as a gateway to locate public toilets
near you and further provide feedback for the need of creation
of new public toilets.
